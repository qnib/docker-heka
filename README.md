# docker-heka
Docker Image that holds hekad daemon.

## Current State is WiP

I haven't wraped my head around this bugga so far. :)

## Goal

I would like to use heka as a routing bus to collect and collect system-metrics, detect basic anomalies and forward metrics and logs.

## Spin it up

So far I can provide a little example configuration.
